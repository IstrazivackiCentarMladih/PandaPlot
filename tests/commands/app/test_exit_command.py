Unit tests for pandaplot.commands.app.exit_command module.

Tests cover the ExitCommand class, including:
- Command initialization
- Execute functionality and event emission
- Undo/Redo error handling (not applicable operations)
- Integration with AppContext and EventBus
- Base Command inheritance
- Edge cases and error conditions
